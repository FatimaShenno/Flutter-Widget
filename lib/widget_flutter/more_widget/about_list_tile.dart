// Use cases
// Form submission: We can use AbsorbPointer to prevent users from submitting a form multiple times by blocking interactions while the form is being processed.

// Loading screens: When displaying a loading screen, we can use AbsorbPointer to block interactions until the loading is complete.

// Complex widgets: If we have complex widgets that contain multiple interactive elements, we can use the AbsorbPointer to selectively block interactions on certain parts of the widget.

// Error states: We can prevent users from interacting with specific UI elements when an error occurs, giving them a clear indication that those elements are not available at the moment.

// it prevents its subtree from being clicked, tapped, scrolled, dragged, and responding to hover.
